                they are meant to help us make decisions and to know what is
                more important when prioritizing. Also, it’s very important that
                our core principles are aligned across all areas, cities and
                iniciatives.

                  To trust is to believe with eyes closed and to delegate

                  bond is built upon exchange: trust to be trusted.

                where we want to be and how we get there. The essential here is
                to have a clear positioning and consistently stand for our

              <p>
                By definition, communication is a mutual understanding between
                two parts. In terms of communicating to others VTEX is very
                challenging: we speak directly to several audiences, with a
                multitude of backgrounds, skills and interests. We spent a lot
                of time trying to understand, categorize and cluster these
                audiences in order to find the best way to efficiently
                communicate with each and everyone.
              </p>

              <p>
                On our way to simplify the brand system and our communications,
                we made a collective effort and defined three main audiences

                    Sometimes the word client can have different meanings,

                    embraces everything related to running a business, which
                    makes it a good fit for our reality and for a better
